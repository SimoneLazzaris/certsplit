# certsplit
= Certsplit =

Extract a certificate from a .pem file containing multiple certificates, allowing quick access to the n-th one.

== Why ? ==

If you deal with x509 certificates, you'll find yourself handling files in PEM having multiple certificate chained. 
And maybe you want to access the 7-th one in a list of 29.
